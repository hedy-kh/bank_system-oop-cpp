### Description

This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation of a basic bank system in C++. It utilizes console input and output and file-based storage to simulate a simple banking system.
<h3><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/R3R_warning.gif" alt="Warning Icon" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; vertical-align: middle;"> Please note that this code is just a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles applied in a real-life scenario. I've used text files as a simple database system to store and retrieve data for demonstration purposes. This is not a complete project, but in upcoming features, I plan to enhance it by implementing Windows Forms with .NET to create necessary interfaces. In a subsequent step, I intend to integrate it with a database system such as PostgreSQL or MSSQL.</h3>


### Upcoming Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Client management (creation, deletion, and modification)
- Transaction recording and management
- Basic account operations (e.g., deposit, withdrawal)

### Installation
